          <div class="wip-text">
            This paper examines how the impact of social housing on residential segregation depends on its spatial distribution and on the social profile of its residents. Using geocoded administrative data from the Netherlands, we show that social housing can either mitigate or reinforce segregation depending on whether it is embedded in mixed urban environments or concentrated in already disadvantaged areas.

          <div class="wip-text">
            This paper, in development with my SEGUE project colleagues, analyses how housing subsidies shape neighbourhood selection among low-income households. The results suggest that subsidy design and market constraints can channel recipients towards more disadvantaged neighbourhoods, with implications for the spatial reproduction of inequality.
